                      <p class="mb-30">"Two years ago, Harikrishnan was overweight, basically fat. Depressed and shocked, Hari dragged himself to the gym so that he wouldn't just be sat at home crying. Fast forward two years, Hari has lost 40lbs, and is now a self-taught newly-qualified personal trainer just without a certification."</p>
                      <p class="mb-30">I tried running on the treadmill at first, thinking that was what he had to do to lose weight, but he didn't enjoy it and it didn't work. He slowly realised that doing something you love and enjoy, consistently, is the key to getting healthier. And, for Hari, that was weightlifting plus walking.</p>
                      <blockquote>If you live long enough, you'll make mistakes. But if you learn from them, you'll be a better person. It's how you handle adversity, not how it affects you. The main thing is never quit, never quit, never quit. - William J. Clinton</blockquote>
                      <p class="mb-30">"Weightlifting completely changed my whole thought process. I fell in love with it. The thought of getting stronger, more empowered and feeling better in myself was such a good feeling. I started focusing less on the weight loss, even though it was happening. I was focusing more on getting stronger."</p>
                      <p class="mb-30">I had also made other lifestyle and diet changes, but none of these involved the typical cardio workouts she was originally so daunted by. Now, I'm keen to remind people that if the idea of a spin class or running a half marathon doesn't appeal to them, it doesn't mean they can't find something that makes them feel good and makes them fitter. "If I hadn't found weightlifting I probably wouldn't have stuck at it to be honest" "I have been trying to lose weight for years. It was only when I gained proper knowledge that things changed. "I also paid attention to my diet by counting 'macros', which is short for macronutrients and includes the three food groups of carbohydrates, proteins and fats. This has allowed me to eat everything in moderation - meaning I can still have favourite meals now and again. For me, it's been a far more efficient way of monitoring her food intake than counting calories. "I actually lost more weight eating 2,000 calories than 1,000"</p>
                      <p class="mb-30">Whereas before, I'd eat out a lot, now I cook my own meals, making healthier versions of her favourite foods like soups and desserts - or snacks. "Don't be disheartened if you have a bad day. All my bad days built better days."</p>

                          <dt>1. DON'T MAKE DRASTIC CHANGES STRAIGHT AWAY</dt>
                          <dd>"The first mistake people make in January is they try to cut everything out. They'll stop drinking, they'll train loads. They go from one extreme to the other. It's about making small adjustments as opposed to doing everything at once. Start by planning your workouts into the week, so you might do three or four sessions a week so you know it's coming, and then start to cut things out.
                          </dd>
                        <dt>2. CARBS ARE NOT THE ENEMY</dt>
                        <dd>""Carbs don't make you gain body fat, it's overeating and storing extra energy that makes you gain body fat. If you prefer getting your energy from fats then have more fats and have less carbs, but if you prefer getting your energy from carbs then obviously you can eat more carbs and reduce your fats. ALWAYS have carbs after you train."
                        </dd>
                      <dt>3. PREP YOUR FOOD AHEAD SO YOU'RE LESS LIKELY TO BE TEMPTED</dt>
                      <dd>"Another thing I talk about which is important is prepping like a boss. Go food shopping and prep your meals ahead, so if you're out and about all the time at least you know your lunch and dinner are ready for when you're home. If you leave the house with nothing healthy and prepared, you're left with fast food which isn't really good. Prepping your food is really important."
                      </dd>
                    <dt>4. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DIET - YOU CAN EAT MORE AND BURN FAT</dt>
                    <dd>"My philosophy is not about a diet, it's a lifestyle. It's about being in control, cooking your food, doing your workouts, not boozing every single night of the week. It's about getting results, and not being hungry. So many diets are low calorie, you starve yourself. Mine's about eating more food to burn fat. It's long term."
                      <dt>5. YOU'LL WORK OUT BETTER WITH A BUDDY</dt>
                      <dd>"If it's really grey and miserable I'll do a HIIT session at home, or go to the gym and do a class. I find that being around people motivates me, if I'm in a class or I've got a trainer shouting at me I'll work a bit harder. It's good to find a workout buddy or someone with a similar schedule as you so you can go to the gym together."
                        <dt>6. HEALTHY FOOD ISN'T EXPENSIVE IF YOU BUY IN BULK</dt>
                        <dd>"It can feel like it's more expensive eating healthily because obviously if you go food shopping and it costs you £100 per week it seems like a lot, but at the same time if you're not doing that and you're eating out, you still spend about £10 a day on a normal working day. It's really not as much as you think, you've got to buy in bulk."
                          <dt>7. EVERYBODY BURNS FAT AT DIFFERENT RATES BUT YOU'LL SEE A DIFFERENCE IN 8 WEEKS</dt>
                          <dd>"Nothing's instant with fat loss, it's always a gradual thing. You need to be patient and don't compare yourself to other people. Everybody burns fat at different rates so you've just got to keep going and push through it. I think 8 weeks to 90 days is when you really start seeing changes in your body. You can see changes in 4 weeks but I'd say 8-12 weeks is when you really start to transform your body."
                            <dt>8. USE TRANSFORMATION PICTURES AS INSPIRATION, NOT COMPARISONS</dt>
                            <dd>"I take transformation pictures for people to be inspired. It's about enjoying the experience I've gone through, rather than just looking at the pictures. Don't be disheartened and compare yourself, use them as inspiration." I even managed to motivate a cousin to shed some weight, WOW!
                              <dt>9. SETTING UNREALISTIC GOALS WILL ONLY DEMOTIVATE YOU</dt>
                              <dd>"The secret to setting realistic goals is planning things that you actually enjoy and can sustain. If you're gonna say 'I'm gonna go to the gym six days a week' but you can't stick to it you're gonna be demotivated, so it's better to say 'I'll go three times a week and do it properly'. Prep your meals is the most important thing, it makes your life less stressful."
                                <dt>10. WALKING CAN BURN A LOT OF FAT</dt>
                                <dd>"I think walking is the best to stick to longterm because if you're really busy, it's 30 minutes of work, you can do it anywhere, read books or code while walking on a treadmill.I would advise an outdoor walk if possible but be careful not to multitask along with it as it can quickly escalate to tragedy if you are not careful. You get so fit so quick, you burn loads of fat. It's the best thing you can do and feel awesome afterwards."
