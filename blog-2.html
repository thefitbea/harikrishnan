                      <p class="mb-30">“No person has the right to rain on your dreams,” said Martin Luther King Jr. People love to laugh at those dreamers who have creative thoughts. They will be called a “weirdo” or “freak.” It happens a lot in high schools. Some of them will give up their dream because they do not want to make others laugh at them. However there are some determined people who never stop dreaming and believe their dreams will come true no matter what others say.  In the movie October Sky, Homer Hickam is a boy who lives in Coalwood, a poor backwards town. Almost every boy in the town believes that he will be a coal miner after graduating from high school. The only way to get out of this town is get a football scholarship and go to college. But Homer is different from the other boys in school; he is not interested in football or being a miner. He wants to build a rocket. When he sees the Russian satellite Sputnik flies across the sky, he knows he found the direction of his life.
                      </p>
                      <p class="mb-30">Although there are many obstacles from his father, Principal Turner and other students, Homer never wants to give up his dream. Finally, he becomes the winner of The National Science Fair and gets a scholarship. A person who has the characteristics such as determination, keen observation and optimism has more chances to make a dream come true. A person with determination would never be afraid of the obstacles and will never easily give up his or her dream. Homer is a determined person because he always knows what he really wants to be and what he needs to work on. In “Sky’s Predictable Forecast”, Desson Howe claims “Homer meets predictable resistance from his father as well as his school principal, who believes all students should learn just enough to go down into the mines.” They could not understand or support a life beyond the “carbon zone.” Rockets sound ridiculous to them. The forest fire also brings Homer and the other rocket boys some trouble. Some police officers arrest them because they are suspected of causing the forest fire.
                      </p>
                      <blockquote>If you are still looking for that one person who will change your life, take a look in the mirror. “The biggest mistake people make in life is not trying to make a living at doing what they most enjoy.”</blockquote>
                      <p class="mb-30">Luckily, they finally find evidence that shows the fire is not their fault. Later, an accident happens underground and Homer’s father John gets badly injured. The company will not pay the medical fees so Homer has to quit school and goes down to the mine in order to earn some money. All the obstacles he faces have not made him give up because he is determined. He never forgets his dream although his father is proud to see him become a miner. But he knows becoming a miner is not what he wants; he wants to build a rocket and win the science fair. That is his dream. Homer gets a lot of help from people in Coalwood, like Miss Riley, Leon Bolden and Ike Bykovsky. When Homer’s rocket flies to the sky, people are proud of the rocket boys. Due to his determination, Homer makes his dream come true. For a determined person, obstacles can never stop their dreams.</p>
                      <p class="mb-30">I think the most important characteristic in life is keen observation. While honesty, wisdom, and humor are all worthwhile characteristics for making dreams come true, they are not enough. An observational person can analyze the situation between himself and other people. Being honest is a good characteristic but people cannot be too honest in some certain situation. For example, if a patient get cancer and he only has six months to live, the doctor cannot tell him directly that he will die after six months. The doctor has to give him some hope to make him have a good motion and there may have miracles appear. Intelligent people are more perceptive than others. If an intelligent people does not have keen observation, he often ignores other`s feelings. The smartest student in the class would answer all the questions that teacher asks and other classmates will have no chance to behave. The behavior maybe not unintentional, but really harms the relationship between classmates sometimes. An observational person always knows when he can highlight his intelligence and when he cannot.
                      </p>
                      <p class="mb-30">A humorous person with keen observation understands whom he can joke with, and what kind of jokes he can talk. An observational person can find out the resources that are useful for him. In October Sky, Homer notices that Quentin knows a lot about rockets and tries to make friend with him. For other students, Quentin is just a weirdo who talks strange things. But for Homer, Quentin is an important partner to help him achieve his dream. An observational person can make everyone comfortable and combine his original honesty, intelligence, and sense of humor to make dreams come true. Optimism is an important factor to make dreams come true. An optimistic person is able to see more chances than a pessimistic person. If there was a half glass of water on the table, a pessimistic person would say, “I only have half a glass left, that is so bad.” But an optimistic person would say “Great! I still have half a glass of water.”</p>
                      <p class="mb-30">Optimists focus on the part that still has opportunity; pessimists only realize the part they have already lost. I read a story about a woman who has two daughters: one owns a dye house, and the other sells umbrellas. The woman is unhappy everyday because when it is rainy her first daughter’s dye house will have no customers; when it is sunny she worries that nobody will buy her second daughter’s umbrellas. One day her neighbor suggests her to think in a different way. On sunny days her first daughter will have a lot of customers and on rainy days her second daughter will sell many umbrellas. After that the old woman becomes happy everyday. For a lot people, they may not have impressive dreams. They just want happy families, good-paying jobs and comfortable lives. Being optimistic could make their dreams come true.</p>
                      <p class="mb-30">Homer Hickam and his partners, in the movie October Sky, fails tens of thousand of times but they never give up. They keep trying and every failure brings useful experience. An optimistic person is confident enough to believe himself that he can be successful one day. That day finally comes to Homer and his rocket boys. In conclusion, determination, keen observation and optimism are the three important factors to make dreams come true. A determinate person has a clear goal and works hard for it. No matter how many obstacles he meets, he would never gives up easily. Keen observation can helps individual keep good relationship with others and finds out the resources that he can use. Optimism makes a person has a positive altitude and being happy everyday. When he meets difficulties on the way accomplish the goals, he would not focus on the past but the future with hopes.</p>
